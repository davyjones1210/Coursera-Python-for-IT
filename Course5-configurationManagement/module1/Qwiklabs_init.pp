class profile {
        file { '/etc/profile.d/append-path.sh':
                owner   => 'root',
                group   => 'root',
                mode    => '0646',
                content => "PATH=/java/bin\n",
        }
}

# Now, the content attribute should be changed. The line content => "PATH=/java/bin\n" should be changed to content => "PATH=\$PATH:/java/bin\n" since we want to append /java/bin to the environment variable $PATH, and not completely replace the current content in $PATH.

The extra backslash before the $ is necessary because Puppet also uses $ to indicate variables. But in this case, we want the dollar sign in the contents of the file.

On top of this, files in the /etc/profile.d directory should only be editable by the root user. In order to do this we'll need to change the mode of the file to avoid giving others permission to write the file. In other words, the mode should be 0644 not 0646.

Once you're done fixing the mode and content attributes, remember to save the file and close it.
